# Insurance Policy Semantic Search & Retrieval System

A complete full-stack semantic search application designed to parse, clean, and retrieve highly relevant policy clauses from insurance agreements. Built using a local **Sentence Transformers** model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`), **NumPy**, and **Scikit-learn** for dense cosine similarity matching, with a **FastAPI** backend and **React** (Vite + Tailwind CSS) frontend.

This project demonstrates a robust, modern document search and retrieval pipeline *without* relying on complex cloud-based vector databases, LangChain, or external LLM API endpoints.

## 🖥️ Application Interface

![Application Interface](./screenshot.png)

### 💡 How It Works
1. **Upload**: Upload an insurance policy PDF.
2. **Index**: The system extracts, cleans, and indexes the document.
3. **Search**: Submit a natural language search query.
4. **Retrieve**: The most relevant policy clause is retrieved and highlighted.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Advanced Line-Based Heading Chunker**: Redesigned document parser that splits text line-by-line, identifies numbered section boundaries (e.g., `3.51 Room Rent`, `4.3 Cataract Treatment`), and segments sections. Overly large sections are split into sub-chunks of max 400 words with headings automatically prepended to preserve retrieval context.
* **Multi-Stage Reranking Pipeline**:
  1. **Semantic Similarity**: Retrieves the Top-5 most relevant chunks from the embedding space.
  2. **Heading-Aware Boost**: Computes query similarity against section headings to filter out similarly worded clauses in unrelated sections (e.g., "Definitions" vs. "Exclusions").
  3. **Keyword-Overlap Scoring**: Extracts query keywords, removes stop words, and scores candidates based on keyword presence to handle compound medical queries.
  * *Final Score Formula*: $0.6 \times \text{Semantic Sim} + 0.2 \times \text{Heading Sim} + 0.2 \times \text{Keyword Overlap}$
* **Robust Text Cleaning**: Dynamically scans lines and filters out repeated page headers, footers, company names (e.g., "National Insurance Co."), policy names ("Arogya Sanjeevani"), page numbering, and UIN/IRDAI codes.
* **Split-Word Repair**: Corrects character separation artifacts introduced during PDF parsing (e.g., `Hospi talization` $\rightarrow$ `Hospitalization`, `t reatment` $\rightarrow$ `treatment`) while dynamically preserving original case formatting.
* **Sentence-Level Retrieval & Context Highlighting**: Splits the best matching chunk into individual sentences, identifies the highest-scoring match to return as `highlighted_sentence`, and surrounds it with immediately adjacent sentences for context.
* **Responsive UX Layout**: Includes drag-and-drop document upload with client-side checks, server-to-client progress indicator, connection status warning banner, clickable search queries suggestions, low similarity warning badges, and safe React mark highlights.

## 🏛️ System Architecture & Retrieval Pipeline

The system retrieves target text chunks using the following deterministic processing flow:

```
[ PDF Upload ]
      │
      ▼
[ PDF Validation ] (Format, Corruption, Empty layers, Size < 20MB)
      │
      ▼
[ Text Extraction ] (Page-by-page parsing using PyPDF2)
      │
      ▼
[ Text Cleaning ] (Header/Footer filters, UIN deletion, Line cleaning)
      │
      ▼
[ Split-Word Repair ] (Re-joining split words like "t reatment" -> "treatment")
      │
      ▼
[ Heading Chunker ] (Line-based section boundaries and Section Detection)
      │
      ▼
[ Embedding Generation ] (Model normalization: normalize_embeddings=True)
      │
      ▼
[ Cosine Similarity ] (Computing 0.6 * chunk score against query vector)
      │
      ▼
[ Heading-Aware Rerank ] (Adding 0.2 * heading similarity score)
      │
      ▼
[ Keyword-Overlap Rerank ] (Adding 0.2 * keyword match score)
      │
      ▼
[ Sentence-Level Retrieval & Context Highlighting ] (Sentence encoding & context retrieval)
      │
      ▼
[ Frontend Result ] (Render text inside JSX <mark> nodes)
```

## 🏃 Running the Application

### 1. Launch FastAPI Server
From the project root directory, run:
```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload --port 8000
```
* The API server will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
* The Sentence Transformers model will load eagerly on startup.
* Set `DEBUG=true` in your environment variables to enable query-rerank terminal logs and `/inspect_chunks`.

### 2. Launch Vite Frontend
From the `frontend` folder, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
* The client dashboard will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

---

## 📡 API Endpoints

### `GET /health`

Verifies server health and checks whether the Sentence Transformer model is loaded in memory.

* **Example Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "ok",
    "model_loaded": true,
    "document_uploaded": true
  }
  ```

### `POST /upload`

Uploads and parses a PDF document. Generates page mappings and caches vectors.

* **Request Header**: `multipart/form-data`

* **Example Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Policy document processed successfully and ready for searching."
  }
  ```

### `POST /query`

Performs multi-stage retrieval against document vectors and returns matching clause coordinates.

* **Body Schema**:
  ```json
  {
    "question": "Pre-existing disease waiting period"
  }
  ```

* **Example Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "answer": "3.2 Waiting Period Pre-existing disease waiting period of 36 months applies from the inception of the policy. Specific diseases list waiting period of 24 months.",
    "highlighted_sentence": "Pre-existing disease waiting period of 36 months applies from the inception of the policy.",
    "page": 20,
    "similarity": 71.36,
    "message": null,
    "heading": "3.2 Waiting Period"
  }
  ```

### `DELETE /reset`

Clears the currently uploaded policy and its in-memory embeddings, wipes the active caches, and clears temporary session configurations.

* **Example Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "System has been reset."
  }
  ```

---

## 📝 Example Queries to Try

Once your insurance policy PDF is uploaded, use the suggestion tags or type in:
1. **Pre-existing disease waiting period** (returns the applicable waiting period terms or equivalent waiting duration clauses for pre-existing conditions)
2. **Room rent limit** (returns the room rent limits or sub-limits clauses)
3. **Ambulance charges** (returns the emergency road transportation expenses or ambulance cost definitions)
4. **Domiciliary hospitalization** (returns the home care treatment terms or domiciliary care parameters)

---

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

* **Searchable PDF Requirement**: The system only extracts text from searchable PDF documents. Scanned or image-only PDFs are not supported.
* **In-Memory Volatility**: Document embeddings and text chunks are stored strictly in-memory (RAM). Restarting the backend server clears the active cache, requiring the document to be re-uploaded.
* **Single-Document Scope**: The application indexes and queries one insurance policy at a time. It does not support persistent multi-document indexing or cross-document search queries in its current state.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* **FAISS Vector Indexing**: Integrate FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to support indexing and querying massive document collections with thousands of sections efficiently.
* **OCR Layer**: Add Tesseract support to parse scanned images or image-only PDF uploads.
* **Multi-Document Uploads**: Query across multiple active policies simultaneously.
